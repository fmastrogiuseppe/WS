Hi! I am a postdoc in Theoretical Neuroscience. My research focuses on neural network models and dimensionality reduction as tools for understanding brain computations.

I obtained my PhD at <font style="color: rgb(83,161,124)">École Normale Supérieure</font> (Paris), under the supervision of S. Ostojic.
I then joined the <font style="color: rgb(83,161,124)">Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit</font> (UCL), where I worked as a post-doctoral fellow together with by P. Latham. During those years, I developed mathematical models to characterize how computations emerge from the synaptic connectivity and activity of artificial and biological circuits.

I am currently a postdoc at the <font style="color: rgb(83,161,124)">Champalimaud Center for the Unknown</font> (Lisbon), where I am working in deciphering large-scale neural data, and I am advised by C. Machens.
